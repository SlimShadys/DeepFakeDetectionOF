# DeepFakeDetectionOF

This repo contains the PyTorch implementation of the paper 'Deepfake Video Detection through Optical Flow based CNN', which can be found [here](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCVW_2019/papers/HBU/Amerini_Deepfake_Video_Detection_through_Optical_Flow_Based_CNN_ICCVW_2019_paper.pdf)

In order to run the notebook locally, make sure to meet the following library requirements:
- tqdm
- gdown
- cv2
- timm
- transformers
- torch

You can install them through:
